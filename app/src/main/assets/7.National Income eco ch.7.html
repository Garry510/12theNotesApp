  <p><strong>Q. 5.  Answer the following</strong><br>
    <strong>1)Explain  the two sector model of circular flow of national income.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> Circular flow of national income is the basic concept of macroeconomics. The  two sector model of circular flow of national income can be explained with the  help of the following points : (1) The two sector model of circular flow of  national income assumes that there are only two sectors, viz. household and  firms in an economy.<br>
    The circular flow of national income between these two sectors is  explained with the help of the following diagram:<br>
    (Kindly  rotate your phones)<br>
  <img width="255" height="367" src="12th eco ch.7_clip_image002.jpg" alt="WhatsApp Image 2020-07-28 at 10.01.19 AM"></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>(2) From the  diagram, it can be seen that households are the owners of factors of  production, viz. land, labour, capital and entrepreneur. Household sector  supplies their services to the firms. Firms produce goods and services by using  the services of factors of production. Firms supply goods and services to the  household sector. Thus, services of factors of production flow from household  sector to firms and goods and services flow from firm to household sector  continuously. This flow is known as real flow or product flow. It is shown by an  outer flow in the above diagram.<br>
    (3) From the  diagram, it can be seen that as household sector supplies land, labour, capital  and entrepreneur to the firm, it in turn receives rent, wages, interest and  profit from the firms. Similarly, as firms supply goods and services to the  household sector, it in turn receives the prices from household sector that are  paid by household sector for purchasing those goods and services. Thus, the  factor payment flows from firm to household sector and price payment flows from  household sector to the firms. This flow is known as money flow. It is shown by  an inner flow in the above diagram.<br>
    (4) From the  diagram, it can be seen that income of household sector gets converted into  consumption expenditure. Similarly, income of firm gets converted into factor  payment. Thus, the flow of income and expenditure continues as production is a  continuous activity due to never ending human wants. It makes the flow of  national income circular between household sector and firms.</p>
  <p><strong>2)  Explain the importance of national income.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> The importance of national income can be explained with the help of the  following points :<br>
    <strong>(1)  Useful for the economy :</strong> The information/ data of national income is very  important for the economy of a country. In present times, the national income  data is regarded as accounts of the economy, which is known as 'Social  Accounts'. It provides information about how the aggregate of a nation's  income, output and product result from the income of different individuals, products  of industries and transactions of international trade.<br>
    <strong>(2)  Helpful in framing national policies :</strong> The statistical data of national  income forms the basis of national policies such as employment policy,  industrial policy, agricultural policy, etc. The information about national  income enables to know the direction in which the industrial output, investment  and saving, etc. change. National Income also helps to generate economic models  like growth model, investment models, etc. Thus, proper measures can be adopted  to bring the economy to the right path. <strong>(3) Helps in economic planning :</strong> For economic planning, data pertaining to national income is very essential.  This includes data related to a country's gross income, output, savings,  investment and consumption which can be obtained from different sources. <br>
    <strong>(4)  Useful in economic research :</strong> National income data is also used by the  research scholars of economics. For example, the data of the country's input,  output, income. savings, consumption, investment employment, etc. which are  obtained from social accounts helps in economic research. <br>
    <strong>(5)  Helpful in comparing standard of living: </strong>National income data helps to  compare the standards of living of people in different countries and of people  living in the same country at different times. For example, the data about  national income of developed countries and undeveloped countries help in  comparing the standard of living of people of these countries.<strong></strong><br>
    <strong>(6)  Helpful in knowing the distribution of income :</strong> National income statistics  enables to know about the distribution of income in the country from the data  related to wages, rent, interest and profits. This data helps in understanding  the economic disparities in the incomes of different sections of the society.</p>
  <p><strong>3)  Explain the features of national income. </strong><br>
    <strong>Ans. The  features of national income are as follows:</strong><br>
    <strong>(1)  Macroeconomic concept :</strong> National income represents income of the economy as  a whole rather than that of an individual. Therefore national income is a macroeconomic  concept.<br>
    <strong>(2)  Inclusion of value of only final goods and services :</strong> In order to avoid  double counting, the value of only final goods and services produced in the  economy are considered while calculating national income. While calculating  national income, the value of intermediate goods or raw materials is not  considered. For example, while estimating the value of sugar, the value of  sugar cane is not taken into account, as it is already included in the price of  the sugar.<br>
    <strong>(3)  Inclusion of net aggregate value :</strong> National income includes net value of  goods and services produced and does not include depreciation cost. (i.e. wear  and tear of capital assets)<br>
    <strong>(4)  Inclusion of net income from abroad:</strong> National income includes net income  from abroad, i.e. difference between export value and import value (X-M) and  net difference between receipts from abroad and payments made abroad (R-P). (5)  Expressed with reference to financial year : National income is always  expressed with reference to a specific time period. In India, it is calculated  for every financial year, i.e. from 1st April to 31st March.<br>
    <strong>(6) Flow  concept : </strong>National income is a flow concept. It shows flow of goods and  services produced in the economy during a financial year. <br>
    <strong>(7)  Expressed in monetary terms :</strong> National income is always expressed in  monetary terms. It represents only those goods and services which are exchanged  for money.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>4)  Explain the concept of Green GNP. </strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> The concept of Green GNP can be explained with the help of the following points  : <br>
    <strong>(A) Need  and Measurement :</strong> <br>
    The need and  measurement of Green GNP can be explained as follows:<br>
    (1) Mere  increase in GNP will not reflect improvement in quality of life, when it  increases environmental pollution or deplete/reduce available resources for  future generations. <br>
    (2) Green  GNP is an indicator of sustainable use of natural environment and equitable  distribution of benefits of development. It thus takes into account the  economic welfare.<br>
    (3) Green  GNP is measured with the help of the following formula : Green GNP = GNP - (Net  fall in stock of natural capital + pollution load.) <br>
  <strong>(B)  Characteristics of Green GNP :</strong> <br>
    Following  are the characteristics of Green GNP:<br>
    (1)  Sustainable economic development, i.e. development which should not cause  environmental degradation (pollution) and depletion of natural resources, <br>
    (2)  Equitable distribution of benefits of its development.<br>
    (3) It  promotes economic welfare for a long period of time.</p>
  <p><strong>Q. 6.  State with reasons, whether you agree or disagree with the following statements  : </strong><br>
    <strong>1) There  are many theoretical difficulties in the measurement of national income.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> Yes, I agree with this statement.<br>
    <strong>Reasons :</strong> Following are some of the theoretical difficulties in measuring national income:<br>
    <strong>(1)  Transfer payments:</strong> Some people from an economy receives pension,  unemployment allowances, etc. Though pension, unemployment allowances, etc. is  considered as an individual's income, it is not an earned income. Individual  receives this income from government's expenditure, Therefore it becomes  difficult to decide whether or not to include such income in national income.<br>
    <strong>(2)  Illegal income :</strong> Illegal incomes received by selling goods and services by  following illegal activities like gambling, black marketing, theft, smuggling etc.  are not included in national income. But these goods and services do have the  value and meet the needs of the consumers. Thus, excluding income from illegal  activities leads to underestimation of national income.<br>
    (3)  Similarly, there are theoretical difficulties in measuring national income  related to unpaid services (for example, services of housewives). production  for self consumption, income of foreign firms, valuation of government  services, changing price level, etc.<br>
    Thus, there  are many theoretical difficulties in measurement of national income.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>(2) Under  output method, value added approach is used to avoid double counting. Ans. Yes,  I agree with this statement.</strong><br>
    <strong>Reasons:</strong> (1) According to output method, the value added at each stage of production process  is included. The difference between the value of final outputs and inputs at  each stage of production is called value added.<br>
    (2) Thus,  GNP is obtained as the sum total of the values added by all different stages of  the production process, till the final output is reached in the hands of  consumers, to meet the final demand.<br>
    (3) This can  be illustrated with the help of the following table :</p>

      <td width="156" valign="top"><p align="center">60</p></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>In the given  example, a farmer produces and sells sugar cane for ₹30 to the sugar  manufacturer. Sugar manufacturer sells sugar for ₹50 to the retailer. Retailer  sells sugar for ₹60 to the consumer. So the value added by farmer (₹ 30),  manufacturer (₹ 20), and retailer (₹ 10) i.e. total of ₹60 is included in  national income.</p>
  <p><strong>Q. 7.  Answer in detail:</strong><br>
    <strong>1)  Explain the practical difficulties involved in the measurement of national  income.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> Practical difficulties in measuring national income are also known as  statistical difficulties in measuring national income. The practical  difficulties in measuring national income are as follows:<br>
    <strong>(1)  Problem of double counting :</strong> The greatest difficulty in calculating  national income is of double counting. It arises from the failure to  distinguish properly, between a final and an intermediate product. For example,  flour used by a bakery is an intermediate product and that by a household is  final product. Therefore, sometimes the flour used by bakery is taken wrongly  as a final product. This results in the problem of double counting. Double  counting leads to overestimation of national income.<br>
    <strong>(2)  Existence of non-monetized sector :</strong> In a developing country like India,  especially in rural areas, there exists the non-monetized sector. In India,  agriculture, still being in the nature of subsistence farming, a major part of  production is consumed at the farm itself and a very small part produced is  exchanged for other goods and services. Thus, exchange activities are carried  out without the use of money. Therefore, they are not calculated in national  income.<br>
    <strong>(3)  Inadequate and unreliable data :</strong> In developing country like India, no  permanent machinery exists for the collection of data. Therefore, adequate and  correct data on production and cost data relating to crops, fisheries, animal  husbandry. forestry, construction workers, small enterprises, etc. are not  available. Besides this data on unearned income, consumption and investment  expenditure of rural and urban population are also not available. This does not  reveal the actual size of national income and it leads to underestimation of  national income.<br>
    <strong>(4)  Depreciation :</strong> Depreciation refers to wear and tear of capital assets, due  to their use in the process of production. There are no uniform, common or  accepted standard rates of depreciation applicable to the various capital  assets. Thus, it is difficult to make correct deductions for depreciation due  to an element of subjectivity.<br>
    <strong>(5)  Capital gains or losses :</strong> Capital gains or capital losses, which accrue to  the property owners by increase or decrease in the market value of their  capital assets or changes in demand, are not included in the national income  because these changes do not result from current economic activities.<br>
    <strong>(6)  Illiteracy and ignorance :</strong> Due to illiteracy and ignorance, small producers  do not keep an account of their production. So they cannot give information  about the quantity or value of their output. This distorts the estimation of  national income.</p>
  <p><strong>(7)  Difficulties in the classification of working population :</strong> In India,  working population is not clearly defined. For instance, farmers in India are  not engaged in agriculture all round the year. Obviously, in the off season,  they engage themselves in alternative occupations. In such a case, it is very  difficult to identify their incomes from a particular occupation. This leads to  underestimation of national income. <br>
    <strong>(8)  Valuation of inventories :</strong> Raw materials, intermediate goods, semi-finished  and finished products in the stock of the producers are known as inventories.  Valuation of inventories requires careful assessment. Any mistake in measuring  the value of inventory, distorts the value of the final production of the  producer which in turn distorts the estimation of national income.</p>
  <p><strong>2)  Explain the income method and expenditure method of measuring national income.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans. (A)  Income method of measuring national income : </strong><br>
    Income method of measuring national income is  also known as factor cost method. This method approaches national income from  the distribution side. This method can be explained with the help of the  following points :<br>
    (1)  According to this method, the income payments received by all citizens of a  country, in a given year are added up. The data pertaining to income are  obtained from income tax returns, reports, books of accounts as well as  estimates from small income.<br>
    (2) In this  method, the incomes accrued to land, labour, capital and entrepreneur in the  forms of rents, wages, interest and profits are all added together. The sum of  factor income is treated as Gross National Product. However, in this method,  the income received in the form of transfer payments is ignored.<br>
    (3) In  India, the national income committee of the Central Statistical Organization  uses the income method for adding up the income arising from trade, transport,  professional and liberal arts, public administration and domestic services. <br>
    (4) GNP  according to income method is calculated as follows : NI = Rent + Wages +  Interest + Profit + Mixed Income + Net income from abroad.<br>
  <strong>(B)  Expenditure method of measuring national income :</strong><br>
    Expenditure  method of measuring national income is also known as Outlay Method. According  to this method, national income is calculated by summing up all consumption  expenditure and investment expenditure made by all individuals. firms as well  as the government of a country during a year. Thus. gross national product is  found by using the following formula : NI = C + I + G + (X-M) + (R-P). <br>
    The  expenditure method can be explained with the help of the following points : <br>
  <strong>(1)  Private Final Consumption Expenditure (C) :</strong> Private final consumption  expenditure by households may be on non-durable goods such as food which are  used immediately, or on durable goods such as car, computer, television set,  washing machine, which are generally used for a longer period of time or on  services such as transport services, medical services, etc. National income  takes into account the private final consumption expenditure.<br>
  <strong>(2) Gross  Domestic Private Investment Expenditure (I) :</strong> It refers to expenditure made  by private businesses on replacement, renewal and new investments. National  income takes into account the gross domestic private investment expenditure.<br>
  <strong>(3)  Government Final Consumption and Investment Expenditure (G) :</strong> Government's  final consumption expenditure refers to the expenditure incurred by government  on various administrative services like law and order, defense, education, etc.  Government's investment expenditure refers to the expenditure incurred by  government on creating infrastructural facilities such as construction of roads,  railways, bridges, dams, canals, which are used by the business sector for  production of goods and services in any economy. National income takes into  account the government final consumption expenditure and investment  expenditure.<br>
  <strong>(4) Net  Foreign Investment/Net Exports (X-M) : </strong>It refers to the difference between  exports and imports of a country during a period of one year. National income  takes into account the value of net exports. <br>
  <strong>(5) Net  receipts (R-P) :</strong> It refers to the difference between expenditure incurred  by foreigners in the country (R) and expenditures incurred abroad by residents  (P). National income takes into account the value of net receipts.</p>
