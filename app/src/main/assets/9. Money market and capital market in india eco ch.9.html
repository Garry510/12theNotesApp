  <p><strong>Q. 7.  Answer the following:</strong><br>
    <strong>1)  Explain the problems faced by the money market in India.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> The problems faced by the money market in India are as follows:<br>
    <strong>(1) Dual  structure: </strong>The money market in India has a dual structure, i.e. organized  sector of money market and unorganized sector of money market. The organized  sector of money market includes the Reserve Bank of India, commercial banks,  co-operative banks, development financial institutions, Discount and Finance  House of India. etc. The unorganized sector of money market in India includes  money lenders, indigenous bankers, unregulated non-bank financing  intermediaries, etc. Due to this dual structure of the money market, there is a  lack of transparency and stability in the Indian money market. There is a lack  of coordination in the unorganized sector of the Indian money market. Also, the  unorganized sector of the Indian money market does not come under the direct  control and supervision of the Reserve Bank of India.<br>
    <strong>(2) Lack  of uniformity in the rates of interest: </strong>The interest rate charged on the  debt in the unorganized money market in India is relatively high. In the  organized money market of India, there exists a difference in the rate of  interest of commercial banks, co-operative banks, non-bank finance companies,  development finance institutions, investment companies, etc. This lack of  similarity in interest rate adversely affects the efficiency of the money  market of India.<br>
    <strong>(3)  Shortage of funds: </strong>Due to limited per capita income, lack of banking habits  among the general public, over-emphasis on useless consumption expenditure,  inadequate banking facilities in rural areas, etc., the savings rate among the  people of India is low. Inadequate savings have led to a shortage of funds in  the money market of India. <br>
    <strong>(4)  Seasonal fluctuations: </strong>In India, during the peak season, i.e. from October  to June, there is a huge demand for finance due to various reasons such as  trading in agricultural products, investing in agro-based businesses, etc.  During the peak season. the demand for finance in the money market is high and  the supply is low, leading to an increase in lending rates. Demand for finance  is relatively low in the post-harvest period, leading to lower borrowing rates.  As a result, the money market of India, especially the unorganized sector,  experiences significant fluctuations in seasonal interest rates and lending  rates, adversely affecting the efficiency of the money market of India.<br>
    <strong>(5) Lack  of financial inclusion: </strong>Banking facilities are not adequately accessible to  the economically weaker lower income groups in India. As a result, people in  this group do not have adequate savings and loan opportunities. As a result,  there is a lack of financial inclusion in the money market of India.<br>
    <strong>(6)  Delays in technological upgradation: </strong>It is essential to use the latest  technology for the development and smooth functioning of the money market. Due  to some delays in the improvement of technology in India, the functioning of  the money market in India is hampered.</p>
  <p><strong>(2)  Explain the functions of commercial banks.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> The functions of commercial banks are as follows:<br>
    (<strong>1)  Accepting deposits: </strong>Deposits are the main source of funds for commercial  banks. Commercial banks accept the following types of deposits:<br>
  <strong>(A)  Demand deposits: </strong>Demand deposits are deposits that are withdrawn on demand. <br>
    The  following are the two types of demand deposits:<br>
  <strong>(a)  Current deposits: </strong>Current deposits are generally kept in current account by  businessmen, corporations and trusts. The account holder can deposit money in  the current deposit account any number of times and withdraw as many times as  demanded. Current deposit account holders are also given the facility of  overdraft, i.e. facility to withdraw in excess of the balance in the account.<br>
  <strong>(b)  Savings deposits: </strong>Savings deposits are held mainly by salaried class and  small traders. The account holder can deposit money in the savings deposit  account at any number of times and withdraw money as and when required. <br>
  <strong>(B) Term  deposits: </strong>Deposits held for a fixed period are called term deposits. The  following are the two types of term deposits: <br>
  <strong>(a)  Recurring deposits: </strong>Recurring deposits are regularly kept in the recurring  deposit account, especially by small savers. Recurring deposits encourage  regular savings.<br>
  <strong>(b) Fixed  Deposits: </strong>Fixed deposits are kept by the saver for a fixed period. The  amount deposited by the saver can be withdrawn after the stipulated period.  Interest is paid at the highest rate on fixed deposits.</p>
  <p><strong>(2)  Providing Loans and advances: </strong>Commercial banks use deposits accepted from  depositors to lend to needy persons. Commercial banks provide short, medium and  long term loans to individuals and institutions for various purposes. The  longer the loan period, the higher is the loan rate. Apart from this,  commercial banks also offer cash credit, overdraft facility and also discount  bills of exchange.</p>
  <p><strong>(3)  Ancillary functions: </strong>Commercial banks provide various facilities like  transfer of funds, collection of money, making periodical payments on behalf of  the customers, safe deposit lockers, D-mat facility, internet banking facility,  mobile banking facility, etc.</p>
  <p><strong>(4)  Credit creation: </strong>Credit creation is an important function of commercial  banks. Commercial banks create credit on the basis of primary deposits.  Commercial banks use demand and term deposits to lend after meeting the cash  reserve requirement. Commercial banks deposit the loan amount in the borrower's  account when lending a loan. Thus, loans are made from primary deposits and  secondary deposits are made while lending loans. Thus, commercial banks create  credit.</p>
  <p><strong>3.  Explain the role of capital market in India.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> The role of the capital market in India is explained in the following points:<br>
    <strong>(1)  Mobilization of long-term savings: </strong>Industrial organizations and the  government need a large amount of funds for investment and financial resources.  Availability of financial resources are insufficient to meet the demand for  these funds. In such a case, the sale of securities by the capital market helps  to bring together the long-term savings of different sections of the  population.<br>
    <strong>(2)  Provision of equity capital: </strong>The capital market provides equity capital to  entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs use the share capital to buy assets for the  industry and to fund business operations.</p>
  <p><strong>(3)  Operational efficiency: </strong>Capital market reduces the cost of transactions and  simplifies the transaction process. Capital market helps financial transactions  to achieve operational efficiency by reducing the time taken to buy and sell  stocks. <br>
    <strong>(4) Quick  valuation: </strong>Capital market helps to determine the fair and quick value of  equities (shares) and debt (bonds and debentures).<br>
    <strong>(5)  Integration: </strong>The capital market coordinates by consolidating the real and  financial sector, equities and debt instruments, public sector and private  sector, domestic and external funds, etc.</p>
  <p><strong>4)  Explain the problems of the capital market in India.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> The following are the problems of capital market in India:<br>
    <strong>(1)  Financial Scams:</strong> Financial scams are on the rise in the Indian capital  market. Rising financial scandals have increased the distrust of the general  public and as a result, investors' confidence in investing in the capital  market has waned. As a result, capital markets face irreparable losses in the  form of declining public confidence.<br>
    <strong>(2)  Insider trading and price manipulation: </strong>Since some individuals have access  to confidential information of companies. Such individuals, for personal gains,  buy and sell securities on the basis of the unpublished confidential  information of companies. Some individuals deliberately raise or lower the  price of shares by buying and selling shares of certain companies for personal  gain. Such illegal transactions are adversely affecting the smooth functioning  of the capital market of India. <br>
    <strong>(3)  Inadequate debt instruments:</strong> In the capital market of India, debt  instruments include bonds, debentures, etc. Due to narrow investor base, high  cost of issuance, restrictions on entry of small and medium enterprises into  the capital market, etc., there is relatively few trading in debt securities.<br>
    <strong>(4)  Decline in the volume of trade:</strong> Capital market investors can trade online.  As a result, capital market investors in various parts of the country prefer to  invest in securities listed in premier stock exchanges like in the Bombay Stock  Exchange and in the National Stock Exchange. As a result, there has been a  sharp decline in trade in regional stock exchanges in India.<br>
    <strong>(5) Lack  of information efficiency: </strong>If the company's current stock price  incorporates all the information about the company, then a market is said to be  informationally efficient. However, the efficiency of information in the Indian  stock market is relatively low compared to other developed countries. As a  result, investors do not get the expected return on investment and thus lose  faith in the capital market.</p>
  <p><strong>Q. 8.  Answer in detail:</strong><br>
    <strong>1)  Explain the role of money market in India.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans:</strong> The role of money market in India can be explained with the help of the  following points: <br>
    <strong>(1)  Meeting the short term requirements of the borrower: </strong>Due to the money  market, the short term financial needs of the borrower are met at realistic  interest rates. <br>
    <strong>(2)  Liquidity management: </strong>Money market facilitates better management of  liquidity and money in the economy by the monetary authorities. As a result,  the country enjoys economic stability and economic development. <br>
    <strong>(3)  Portfolio management:</strong> Money market deals with different types of financial  instruments that are designed to suit the risk and return preferences of  investors. This enables the investors to manage portfolio to minimize the risks  and to maximise the returns.</p>
  <p><strong>(4)  Equilibrating mechanism: </strong>Money market leads to rational allocation of  financial resources. The money market accelerates savings in the investment  stream. The money market helps to strike a balance between the demand for and  the supply of short-term funds.<br>

The money market guides the Reserve Bank of India in developing  appropriate interest rates. Thus, a fully developed money market in the economy  helps in the successful implementation of monetary policy. <br>
    <strong>(7)  Economising the use of cash: </strong>The money market is not about the actual money  but about various financial instruments that are the close substitute to money.  As a result, the money market helps to use cash sparingly.<br>
    <strong>(8)  Promoting the growth of commerce, industry and trade: </strong>Local traders as well  as international traders who are in the need of short term funds have the  facility to discount bills of exchange in the money market. Money market  provides working capital for agro-industries and small scale industries. As a  result, the money market drives the growth of commerce, industry and trade in  the country.</p>
  <p><strong>(2)  Explain the functions of the RBI. </strong><br>
