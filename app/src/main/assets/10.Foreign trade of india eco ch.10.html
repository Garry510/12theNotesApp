  <p><strong>Q. </strong><strong>4.Answer the following:</strong><br>
    <strong>1) Explain the concept of foreign trade and its types.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans: (A)  Concept of foreign trade :</strong> The concept of foreign trade is as follows: <br>
    (1) Foreign trade is trade between different countries of  the world. Foreign trade also called international trade or external trade.<br>
    (2) According to Wasserman and Hultman, &quot;International  trade consists of transactions between residents of different countries.&quot; <br>
  <strong>(B) Types  of foreign trade :</strong> The types of foreign trade are as follows:<br>
  <strong>(1) Import trade :</strong> Purchase of goods and services by  one country from another country is called import trade. The influx of goods  and services from abroad to home country is called import trade. For example,  India buys petroleum from Iraq. Kuwait, Saudi Arabia. <br>
  <strong>(</strong><strong>2) Export trade :</strong> The sale of goods and services by one  country to another is called export trade. The outflow of goods and services  from home country to abroad is called export trade. For example, India sells  tea, rice, jute to China, Hong Kong and Singapore. <br>
  <strong>(</strong><strong>3) Entrepot trade :</strong> The process of processing goods  imported from one country and exporting them to another country is called  entrepot trade. For example, Japan imports raw materials for the manufacture of  electronics from England, Germany, France, etc. processes the raw materials to  make electronic goods such as radios, washing machines, televisions and exports  these goods to various countries of the world.</p>
  <p><strong>(3) Explain any four features of composition of India's  foreign trade. </strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> The features of composition of India's foreign trade are as follows: <br>
    <strong>(</strong><strong>1) Increasing share of GDP :</strong> The share of India's  foreign trade in GDP is steadily increasing. The share of India's foreign trade  in GDP was only 17.55 per cent in 1990-91. It increased to 25 per  cent in 2006-07 and 48.08  per cent in 2016-17.<br>
    <strong>(2) Increase in the volume and value of trade: </strong>Since 1990-91, the volume and value of India's foreign trade has  been increasing. India currently exports and imports a wide range of high value  goods and services.<br>
    <strong>(3) Changes in the composition of exports:</strong> Before  independence, India used to export basic commodities like jute, cotton, tea,  oilseeds, leather, food grains, cashew nuts, mineral products to other  countries. Since independence, India has started exporting readymade garments,  gems and jewellery, computer hardware and software. Thus the composition of  India's exports has changed.<br>
    <strong>(4) Changes in the composition of imports : </strong><br>
    Before  independence, India used to import a large number of consumer goods such as  medicines, cloth, motor vehicles, electrical goods, etc. At present, India is a  major importer of petrol and petroleum. high-tech machinery, chemicals,  fertilizers, steel, etc.<br>
  <strong>(5) Oceanic trade :</strong> Most of India's foreign trade is by  sea. About 68% of India's total foreign trade is  done by sea. India also has foreign trade relations with neighbouring countries  like Nepal, Afghanistan, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, etc.<br>
  <strong>(6) Development of new ports :</strong> Large scale foreign  trade was carried out in India mainly from important ports like Mumbai,  Kolkata, Chennai, etc. Therefore these ports were overburdened.<br>
    Therefore,  new ports like Kandla, Cochin Visakhapatnam. Nhava Sheva, etc. have been  developed in India to reduce the additional burden on the existing ports.</p>
  <p><strong>3) Explain the trend in India's imports. </strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> The trend in India's imports can be explained with the help of the following  points: <br>
    <strong>(</strong><strong>1) Petroleum :</strong> Petroleum has been an important item in  India's import trade even before and after the economic reforms. Petroleum  imports accounted for about 27 per cent of India's total  imports in 1990-91. At present, petroleum imports  account for about 31 per cent of India's total  imports. India has been importing the largest amount of petroleum for years.<br>
    <strong>(2) Gold :</strong> Gold is the second most imported commodity  in India after petroleum. Gold imports of India declined significantly in 2013-14. India gold imports fell to 27.5  billion in 2013-14 from 53.3  billion in 2010-11. The fall in international  gold prices and the consequent policy of restrictions by the government on gold  imports have led to a sharp decline in gold imports.<br>
    <strong>(3) Fertilizers :</strong> Fertilizers accounted for about 4.1 per cent of India's total imports in 1990-91.  In 2016-17, the share declined to 1.3 per cent.<br>
    <strong>(4) Iron and Steel : </strong>In 1990-91,  the share of iron and steel imports in the total imports of India was about 4.9 per cent. At present, the share declined to 2.1 per cent.</p>
  <p><strong>Q. </strong><strong>5. State with reasons whether you agree or disagree with  the following statements :</strong></p>
  <p><strong>1) During British rule, indigenous handicrafts suffered a  severe blow.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans:</strong> Yes, I agree with this statement.<br>
    <strong>Reasons :</strong> (1) Prior to 1947,  India was a British colony. <br>
    Therefore,  India's foreign trade was colonial. <br>
    (2) Before independence, India mainly exported raw materials  to England and imported finished goods from England. Prior to independence,  India relied heavily on trade with England for industrial goods. <br>
    (3) In the pre-independence period, England started selling  large quantities of finished goods made in factories in England to India. As a  result, many people in India started buying goods from England and this reduced  the demand for indigenous goods. As a result, many small and medium enterprises  in India closed down. Thus, during British rule, indigenous handicrafts  suffered a severe blow.</p>
  <p><strong>(2) Trade is an engine of growth for an economy</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> Yes, I agree with this statement. <br>
    <strong>Reasons:</strong> (1) Foreign trade carns foreign  exchange. The foreign exchange received can be used for various productive  activities. <br>
    (2) Foreign trade provides an opportunity for domestic  producers to sell goods and services in the domestic market as well as export  to the world market.<br>
    (3) Encouragement of production and market expansion of  indigenous goods and services encourages large scale investment in various  industries in the country. Large investments increase employment levels and  national income, leading to economic growth in the economy. Thus, trade is an  engine of growth for an economy.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>(3) Foreign trade leads to division of labour and  specialization at world level.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> Yes, I agree with this statement. <br>
    <strong>Reasons :</strong> (1) In foreign trade, each country  seeks to maximize production of various goods and services at minimum cost  according to the quantity and quality of labour available to it.<br>
    (2) For example, if there are unskilled and abundant  labourers available in 'A country, then such a country produces a large  quantity of agricultural produce and exports agricultural produce to other  countries. 'B' is a country that produces a large number of electronic goods  and exports them to other countries if it has a skilled and limited number of  workers.<br>
    (3) In foreign trade, each country consistently promotes  the production of specific goods or services with the help of available labour  so that maximum profit can be made. <br>
    Thus,  foreign trade leads to division of labour and specialization at world level.</p>

  <p><strong>Q. </strong><strong>7. Answer in detail :</strong><br>
    <strong>1) Explain the meaning and role of foreign trade.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans:</strong> (A) Meaning of foreign trade : The concept of foreign trade is as follows:<br>
    (1) Foreign trade is trade between different countries of  the world. Foreign trade is also called international trade or external trade. <br>
    (2) According to Wasserman and Hultman, &quot;International  trade consists of transactions between residents of different countries.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>(B) Role of foreign trade :</strong> The role of foreign trade  can be explained with the help of the following points :<br>
    (1) To earn foreign exchange : Foreign exchange is earned  through foreign trade. The foreign exchange received can be used for various  productive activities. Foreign trade promotes the production and market  expansion of domestic goods and services.<br>
  <strong>(2) Encourages investment :</strong> Foreign trade provides an  opportunity for producers to sell goods and services in the domestic market as  well as export to the world market. As a result, the production of various  goods and services in the country is boosted and investment is encouraged.<br>
  <strong>(3) Division of labour and specialization: </strong>Foreign  trade leads to division and specialization of labour at the global level. For  example, if workers in country A are skilled in agricultural production and  workers in country 'B' are skilled in making <br>
    electronic  products, then country 'A' can export agricultural products to country 'B' by  acquiring specialization in agricultural products. 'B' country can export  electronic products to A country by acquiring specialization in electronic products.<br>
  <strong>(4) Optimum allocation and utilization of resources :</strong> Due to foreign trade, each country channelized the available resources to the  production of the same goods from which maximum benefit can be obtained at  minimum production cost. For example, if it would be able to produce wheat at  the lowest cost based on the resources available in country 'A' and if it would  be possible to produce medicines at the lowest cost based on the production  resources in country 'B', then country 'A manufactures wheat and export wheat  to country 'B'. Similarly, country 'B' manufactures drugs and exports drugs to  country 'A'. Thus foreign trade leads to adequate allocation and utilization of  resources internationally. <br>
  <strong>(</strong><strong>5) Stability in price level :</strong> Foreign trade helps in  balancing the demand and supply of goods and hence brings stability in price  level in the economy.<br>
  <strong>(6) Availability of multiple choices :</strong> Foreign trade  provides multiple choices of imported commodities. It thus creates competition  in the market and hence high quality goods can be made available to the  consumers at reasonable prices. Thus, foreign trade helps in raising the  standard of living<br>
  <strong>(7) Brings reputation and helps earn goodwill :</strong> Exporting countries get reputation and goodwill in the international market.  For example, Japan and Switzerland have gained a great deal of goodwill in the  international market by exporting electronic goods worldwide.</p>
  <p><strong>(2) Explain the recent trends in India's export. </strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> The recent trends in India's export is as follows:<br>
    <strong>(1) Engineering goods :</strong> According to the report of the  Engineering Goods Export Promotion Council (GEPC), the exports of engineering  goods accounted for about 25 per cent of India's total  exports in 2017-18. These items mainly included  automobiles and auto components, machinery and equipment, computer hardware and  software. From 2010-11 to 2014-15.  India's exports of transport equipment amounted to 16  billion US dollars to 24.8 billion US dollars.</p>
  <p><strong>(2) Petroleum products :</strong> Significant increase have  taken place in India's petroleum capacity since 2001-02.  As a result, India became exporter of petroleum refinery products.  Between 2001-02 and 2013-14,  India's share of petroleum products exports grew sharply from 4.3  per cent to 20.1 per cent.<br>
    <strong>(3) Chemicals and chemical products :</strong> In the last few  years, India has exported a large number of chemicals and chemical products. At  present, chemicals and chemical products account for about 10.4  per cent of India's total exports.<br>
    <strong> (4) Gems and  jewellery :</strong> Gems and jewellery make a significant contribution to India's  exports. Gems and jewellery accounted for about 13.3  per cent of India's total exports in 2014-15.<br>
