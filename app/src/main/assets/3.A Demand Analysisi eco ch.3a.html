  <p><strong>Q. 4.  State with reasons whether you agree or disagree with the following statements:</strong><br>
    <strong>1) Demand  curve slopes downward from left to right.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> Yes, I agree with this statement.<br>
    <strong>Reasons:</strong> (1) According to the Law of Demand propounded by Dr. Alfred Marshall,  &quot;Other things being equal as price falls demand tends to rise and as price  rises demand tends to fall.&quot;<br>
    <strong>(2) This  statement can be explained with the help of the following diagram:</strong><br>
    <strong><img src="12th eco ch.3a_clip_image002.jpg" alt="" width="332" height="292"></strong><br>
    From the  above diagram it can be seen that as price rises from OP to OP, demand falls  from OQ to 0g. Similarly, as price falls from OP to OP, demand rises from OQ to  OQ¹. Demand curve. Le. DD indicates the inverse relationship between the price  and the quantity demanded of a commodity,<br>
    (3)  Diminishing marginal utility, income effect. substitution effect multipurpose  uses. new consumers, etc. are the reasons for demand curve sloping downward  from left to right.<br>
    Thus, demand  curve slopes downward from left to right.</p>
  <p><strong>2) Price  is the only determinant of demand.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> No, I disagree with this statement.<br>
    <strong>Reasons:</strong> The determinants of demand are as follows:<br>
    <strong>(1)  Price:</strong> Price is one of the most important factors that affect market  demand. Usually, larger quantity is demanded at a lower price and vice versa.<br>
    <strong>(2)  Income:</strong> Income is yet another important factor that affects market demand.  Income affects the purchasing power of a consumer. Income and demand are  directly related to each other. Normally, demand rises with increasing income  and vice versa.<br>
    <strong>(3)  Prices of Substitute Goods:</strong> Market demand also gets influenced by the  prices of substitutes. If a substitute is available at a lower price, people  demand the substitute goods in greater quantities than the commodity in  question. For example, if the price of tea falls, demand for coffee tends to  fall.<br>
    <strong>(4)  Prices of Complementary Goods:</strong> Market demand also gets affected by the prices  of complementary goods. If the price of a complementary good rises, the demand  of the commodity in question tends to fall. For example, if the price of petrol  rises, demand for cars tends to fall.<br>
    <strong>(5)  Nature of products:</strong> If a commodity is a necessity and its use is  unavailable, then its demand will continue to be the same irrespective of  change in its price. For example, demand for salt, medicines, etc. Thus. nature  of commodity determines the demand.<br>
    <strong>(6) Size  of Population:</strong> Demand for various goods and services gets affected by the  size as eu as the composition of population. An increase in population leads to  an increase in demand for a variety of goods and services. On the other hand  decrease in population leads to decrease in demand for a variety of goods and  services.<br>
    <strong>(7) Expectations  about future prices:</strong> Expectations about future prices also determines the  demand. For example, if consumers expect fall in the price of a particular  commodity in the near future, they will demand less quantities of such  commodity though its present price is comparatively less and vice versa.<br>
    <strong>(8)  Advertisements: </strong>Nowadays, the market demand for goods and services gets  highly influenced by advertisements and other promotional activities.  Attractive advertisements, sales promotion schemes and effective salesmanship  lead to increase in demand for various goods and services, For example, demand  for toothbrush, cosmetics, etc.<br>
    <strong>(9)  Tastes, Habits and Fashions</strong> Some factors such as taste, habit of consumers,  etc. also determine the demand. For example, an increased liking for cold  drinks, ice creams, etc. increases their demand. Similarly, commodities in  fashion have more demand and the commodities out of fashion have less demand.<br>
    <strong>(10)  Level of Taxation:</strong> Government's taxation policy also affects demand. For  example, a rise in tax level reduces the consumer's disposable income and it in  turn decreases the demand for different goods and services and vice versa.<br>
    <strong>(11)  Other Factors:</strong> Climatic conditions (Flood, Drought. Earthquake). Change in  technology government policies, customs and traditions, etc. Other factors also  affect demand for various goods and services.</p>
  <p><strong>3) When  price of Giffen goods falls, the demand for it increases</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> No, I disagree with this statement Reasons: <br>
    (1) Sir  Robert Giffen from England noticed that in the case of inferior quality  products (Giffen good) the Law of Demand does not hold good. When the price of  Giffen goods falls, buyers real income gets increased. As its effect, they  demand more of superior quality goods. <br>
    (2) For  example, when the price of vanaspati ghee falls, (its demand remains less), the  demand for pure ghee rises. <br>
    (3) Thus,  fall in prices of Giffen goods leads to fall in their demand. Therefore Giffen  goods are considered as exception to the Law of Demand. This phenomenon is  known as Giffen's paradox. Thus, when price of Giffen goods falls, the demand  for it does not increase but decreases.</p>

  <p><strong>6. Answer  the following questions in detail:</strong><br>
    <strong>(1) State  and explain the Law of Demand. </strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> The Law of Demand can be stated and explained with the help of the following  points: <br>
    <strong>(1) Law  of Demand:</strong> The Law of Demand is one of the fundamental laws of consumption.  It was propounded by Dr. Alfred Marshall in his famous book, 'Principles of  Economy is'. The Law of Demand explains the inverse relationship between the  price and the quantity demanded.<br>
    <strong>(2)  Statement of Law:</strong> &quot;Other things being equal, the amount demanded rises  with a fall in price: and diminishes with a rise in price.&quot;<br>
    <strong>(3)  Symbolical Representation:</strong> The law of demand is expressed symbolically as  follows:<br>
    <img src="12th eco ch.3a_clip_image010.png" alt="" width="148" height="41"> <br>
    Where, D  stands for demand for a commodity x, f stands for function of, Px stands for the  price of the commodity x.<br>
  <strong>(4)  Individual Demand Schedule:</strong> The Law of Demand is explained in the following  individual demand schedule:</p>
  <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td width="312" valign="top"><br>
        <strong>Price (rupees) of commodity x</strong></td>
      <td width="312" valign="top"><p><strong>Individual Demand of Commodity x (per day in units)</strong></p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="312" valign="top"><p>1</p></td>
      <td width="312" valign="top"><p>5</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="312" valign="top"><p>2</p></td>
      <td width="312" valign="top"><p>4</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="312" valign="top"><p>3</p></td>
      <td width="312" valign="top"><p>3</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="312" valign="top"><p>4</p></td>
      <td width="312" valign="top"><p>2</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="312" valign="top"><p>5</p></td>
      <td width="312" valign="top"><p>1</p></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p><strong>(5) Explanation  of Individual Demand Schedule:</strong> From the above individual demand schedule it  can be observed that at a lesser price (1) more units of commodity x are  demanded (5 units). Similarly at a higher price (rupeee 5) less units of  commodity x are demanded (1 unit). Thus, there exists an inverse relationship  between the price and the quantity demanded.<br>
    <strong>(6)  Individual Demand Curve: </strong>The Law of Demand can be explained with the help  of the following diagram of the individual demand curve:<br>
    <strong>(7)  Explanation of Individual Demand Curve: </strong>In the above diagram, Y-axis  represents the price of the commodity x and X-axis represents demand of  commodity x. From the above diagram it can be seen that the demand curve, i.e.  DD slopes downwards from the left to the right. Price and demand are inversely  related to each other. Therefore, the demand curve has negative slope.</p>
  <p><strong>2) Explain  in detail the determinant of demand</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> <strong>(1)  Price:</strong> Price is one of the most important factors that affect market  demand. Usually, larger quantity is demanded at a lower price and vice versa.<br>
    <strong>(2)  Income:</strong> Income is yet another important factor that affects market demand.  Income affects the purchasing power of a consumer. Income and demand are  directly related to each other. Normally, demand rises with increasing income  and vice versa.<br>

If a substitute is available at a lower price, people  demand the substitute goods in greater quantities than the commodity in  question. For example, if the price of tea falls, demand for coffee tends to  fall.<br>
    <strong>(4)  Prices of Complementary Goods:</strong> Market demand also gets affected by the prices  of complementary goods. If the price of a complementary good rises, the demand  of the commodity in question tends to fall. For example, if the price of petrol  rises, demand for cars tends to fall.<br>

    <strong>(6) Size  of Population:</strong> Demand for various goods and services gets affected by the  size as eu as the composition of population. An increase in population leads to  an increase in demand for a variety of goods and services. On the other hand  decrease in population leads to decrease in demand for a variety of goods and  services.<br>

For example, if consumers expect fall in the price of a particular  commodity in the near future, they will demand less quantities of such  commodity though its present price is comparatively less and vice versa.<br>
