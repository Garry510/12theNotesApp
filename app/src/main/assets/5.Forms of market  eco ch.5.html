  <p><strong>Q.5  answer the following:</strong><br>
    <strong>1) Explain  the features of oligopoly.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.  (A) Meaning:</strong> The term oligopoly is derived  from the Greek words 'Oligo' which means few and 'poly' which means sellers.  Thus, oligopoly is a market where there are a few firms (sellers) in the market  producing and selling either a homogeneous product or a differentiated product.  For example, few firms providing mobile services.<br>
    <strong>(B)  Features:</strong> <strong>The features of oligopoly are as follows:</strong> (1) Few firms or  sellers: Under oligopoly market, there are few firms or sellers. From these few  firms, some firms dominate the market and enjoy a considerable control over the  price of a product.<br>
    <strong>(2)  Interdependence:</strong> Under oligopoly market. every seller has to be cautious  with respect to any action taken by the competing firms. Since there are few  sellers in the market, if any firm makes the change in the price, all other  firms in the industry also try to follow the same to remain in the competition.<br>
    <strong>(3)  Advertising:</strong> Advertising is a powerful instrument in the hands of  oligopolist. A firm under oligopoly uses aggressive and attractive advertising  campaign with the intention of capturing a large part of the market. The cost  incurred on advertising is called selling cost.<br>
    <strong>(4) Entry  barriers:</strong> Under oligopoly market, any firm can easily exit from the  industry whenever it wants or when there is possibility of losses. On the other  hand, a new firm has to face certain natural, technical entry barriers as well  as legal entry barriers like government license, patents, etc.<br>
    <strong>(5) Lack  of uniformity:</strong> Under oligopoly, there is a lack of uniformity among the  firms in terms of their size. Under oligopoly, some firms may be small with  respect to its business operations while others may be of bigger size with  respect to their business operations. <br>
    <strong>(6)  Uncertainty: </strong>Uncertainty is an important feature of oligopoly market. There  is a considerable element of uncertainty due to change in demand of products as  an effect of advertisements as well as different behaviour patterns shown by  various firms. For example, in oligopoly market, rivals may Join hands and  co-operate or may try fight each other.</p>
  <p><strong>2) Explain  the types of monopoly.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> The following are the types of monopoly: <br>
    <strong>(1)  Private monopoly:</strong> Private monopoly refers to sole ownership of the supply  of goods or services by the private firm or individual. The main objective of  private monopoly is earning the maximum profit. For example, Tata Group<br>
    (<strong>2)  Public monopoly:</strong> Public monopoly refers to sole ownership of the supply of  goods or services by the government. The main objective of public monopoly is  not to earn the profit but to provide, the maximum welfare to the society. For  example Indian Railways.<br>
  <strong>(3) Legal  monopoly:</strong> The monopoly that emerges on account of legal provisions like  patents trade mark, copyrights, etc. is called legal monopoly, In a legal  monopoly, the law forbids the potential competitors to imitate the design, form  or shape of a product which is registered with a particular trade mark. If any  firm violates the rights of the trade mark, legal action is taken against them.  For example, Amul's products. <br>
  <strong>(4)  Natural monopoly</strong>: The monopoly created on the basis of natural conditions  like climate, rainfall, specific location, etc. is known as natural monopoly.  For example, monopoly created by the state of Punjab in the production of wheat  due to favourable climatic conditions and fertile soil. <br>
  <strong>(5)  Simple monopoly:</strong> It is a type of monopoly, in which a monopolist charge  consumer wise, place<br>
    wise, time  wise and use wise uniform price to the same product.<br>
  <strong>(6)  Discriminating monopoly:</strong> It is a type of monopoly, in which a monopolist  charge consumer wise, place wise, time wise and use wise different prices to  the same product. For example, In India, the electricity charges are  comparatively less for its domestic use and comparatively high for its  commercial use.<br>
  <strong>(7)  Voluntary monopoly:</strong> It is a type of monopoly where some monopolists  voluntarily come together and form a group of monopolists to avoid cut-throat  competition. This facilitates them to maximise the profit. For example,  Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).</p>

  <p><strong>Q. 7.  Answer in detail:</strong><br>
    <strong>1)  Explain the meaning of Monopolistic competition with its features.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> <strong>Meaning:</strong> Monopolistic competition is very realistic in nature. In this market, there are  some features of perfect competition and some features of monopoly acting  together. Prof. E. H. Chamberlin coined the concept of monopolistic competition  in his book &quot;Theory of Monopolistic Competition&quot; which was published  in 1933. According to Chamberlin, &quot;Monopolistic competition refers to  competition among a large number of sellers producing close but not perfect  substitutes.&quot;<br>
    <strong></strong><br>
  <strong>Features:  (1) Fairly large number of sellers:</strong> Although the number of sellers in a  monopolistic competition is large, it is still smaller than that in a perfectly  competitive market. Since number of sellers is large. each seller has a limited  control over the market supply. However, each seller has monopoly over his  brand. Thus, in monopolistic competition cach producer enjoys an element of  monopoly on one hand and on the other they have to face competition from  sellers selling close substitutes.<br>
  <strong>(2)  Fairly large number of buyers:</strong> In monopolistic market, there are fairly  large number of buyers. Consequently, no single buyer can influence the price  of the product by changing his individual demand.<br>
  <strong>(3)  Product differentiation:</strong> Product differentiation is the main feature of  monopolistic competition. In monopolistic competition, there are many firms  producing differentiated products. In this market, the product of each firm is  in some way differentiated from the product of every other firm in the market.  Product differentiation may take the form of brand names, trademarks,  peculiarity of package or container, shape, quality, cover, design, colour,  etc. This means that the product of each firm may find close substitutes and  the cross elasticity of demand for each firm's product is very high. For  example, mobile handsets, soaps, toothpastes, two wheelers, etc.<br>
  <strong>(4) Free  entry and exit:</strong> Under monopolistic competition there is freedom of entry  and exit. The new firms are free to enter the market if there is opportunity of  earning profit. Similarly, existing firms can exit the market, if they find it  difficult to survive due to possibility of losses.<br>
  <strong>(5)  Selling Cost:</strong> Selling cost is a peculiar feature of monopolistic  competition. Selling cost refers to the cost incurred by the firm to create  more demand for its product and thus increase the volume of sales. Selling cost  includes expenditure on advertisements, radio and television broadcasts,  hoardings, exhibitions, window display, free gifts, free samples, etc.<br>
  <strong>(6) Close  substitutes:</strong> In monopolistic competition, goods have close substitutes to  each other. For example, different brands of cold drinks, biscuits, tea, etc.<br>
  <strong>(7)  Concept of group:</strong> Under monopolistic competition, Chamberlin introduced the  concept of 'Group' in place of industry. Industry means the number of firms  producing identical products. On the other hand, a 'Group' means a number of  firms producing differentiated products which are closely related to each  other. For example, group of firms producing medicines, automobiles, etc.</p>
  <p><strong>2)  Explain the meaning of Perfect competition with its features.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> According to Mrs. Joan Robinson, &quot;Perfect competition prevails when the  demand for the output of each producer is perfectly elastic.&quot; The features  of perfect competition are as follows: <br>
    <strong>(1) Large  number of buyers and sellers:</strong> <strong>(a) Large number of buyers:</strong> In perfect  competition, there is a large number of potential buyers buying commodity in  market. Their number is so large that a single buyer cannot influence the  market price. Thus, in perfect competition, a buyer is a price taker.<br>
    <strong>(b) Large  number of sellers:</strong> In perfect competition, there is a large number of  potential sellers selling their commodity in the market. Their number is so  large that the single seller cannot influence the market price. The price of  the product is determined by the interaction of market demand and market supply  of a commodity. Thus, in perfect competition, a seller is a price taker.<br>
    <strong>(2)  Homogeneous product:</strong> In perfect competition, every firm produces and sells  identical products, 1.e. units of a commodity produced by each firm are uniform  in respect of their size, shape, colour, quality, etc. Therefore, the  commodities sold in perfect market are perfect substitutes to one another.<br>
    <strong>(3) Free  entry and exit: </strong>In perfect competition, any firm can freely enter or can  exit the market without any restrictions. If there is a hope of profit, a new  firm can easily enter the market. Similarly, ir there is possibility of losses,  the existing firm can freely exit the market.<br>
    (4) Single  price: In perfect competition, all units of a commodity have uniform price and  it is determined by the equilibrium of the market demand and market supply.<br>
  <strong>(5)  Perfect knowledge of market:</strong> In perfect competition, the buyers as well as  sellers have perfect knowledge of market conditions such as price of product quality  of product, source of supply of product, etc.<br>
  <strong>(6)  Perfect mobility of factors of production:</strong> In perfect competition, land has  occupational mobility and other factors of production viz. labour, capital and  entrepreneur have occupational mobility as well as geographical mobility. <br>
  <strong>(7)  Absence of transport cost:</strong> It is assumed that there is no transport cost in  perfect competition. Therefore, uniform price prevails in perfect competition.<br>
  <strong>(8) No  government intervention: </strong>Laisses faire policy prevails under perfect  competition. It means that there is no government intervention in economic  activities.</p>
