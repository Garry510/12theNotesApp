  <p><strong>Q. 6.  Answer the following questions:</strong><br>
    <strong>1)  Explain the factors influencing elasticity of demand.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans. The  factors influencing elasticity of demand are as follows: </strong><br>
    <strong>(1)  Nature of Commodities:</strong> Nature of commodities is one of the important  factors influencing the elasticity of demand. We can classify commodities as  necessaries, comforts and luxury goods. The necessary goods like salt,  medicines, etc. have less elastic demand. On the other hand, comfort and luxury  goods like cars, perfumes, jewellery, etc. have more elastic demand.<br>
    <strong>(2)  Availability of Substitute Goods:</strong> A commodity having larger number of  substitutes tends to have elastic demand and vice versa. For example, due to  the availability of larger number of substitutes, the demand for cold drinks  tends to be elastic. Similarly due to a lack of substitutes, the demand for salt  is inelastic. <br>
    <strong>(3)  Number of uses:</strong> A commodity which has specific use has less elastic demand.  For example, a demand for a particular vegetable is less elastic. A commodity  which can be put to several uses has elastic demand. When the price of such a commodity  falls. It is put into various uses. Similarly when the price of such a  commodity rises, it is put only for important purposes. For example,  electricity has elastic demand.<br>
    <strong>(4)  Habits:</strong> The demand for habituated goods tends to be inelastic. For example,  a smoker's demand for cigarettes is inelastic. On the other hand, the demand  for non-habituated goods tends to be elastic. For example, demand for biscuits  is more elastic.<br>
    <strong>(5)  Durability:</strong> Elasticity of demand also gets influenced by the durability of  a commodity Durable commodities such as washing machine. television set tend to  have elastic demand and the perishable commodities such as milk, eggs tend to  have inelastic demand.<br>
    (<strong>6)  Complementary Goods:</strong> Demand for complementary goods is inelastic. Complementary  goods are demanded jointly. Therefore, their demand remains almost fixed. For  example, the demand only for sim card or mobile phone tends to be inelastic.  The goods which are not complementary to each other have more elastic demand.  For example, the demand of only magazines or only cold drinks is elastic.<br>
  <strong>(7)  Income of consumer:</strong> The demand for commodities tends to be inelastic with a  rise in income and elastic with a fall in income. For example, a rich person's  demand for a particular commodity may be inelastic, but a poor person's demand  for that same commodity may be elastic.<br>
    (<strong>8)  Urgency of needs:</strong> The commodities that are needed urgently, i.e. the  commodities whose consumption cannot be postponed have less elastic demand. For  example, demand for medicines. On the other hand, the commodities that are not  needed urgently, i.e. the commodities whose consumption can be postponed have  more elastic demand, E example, demand for computer.<br>
  <strong>(9) Time  period:</strong> In a short run, the demand for specific commodity may tend to be  inelastic. In the long run, a consumer may demand a cheaper substitute  commodity. Thus, the demand for an original commodity tends to be elastic in  the long run.</p>
  <p><strong>(2)  Explain the total outlay method of measuring elasticity of demand?</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> (1) Total Outlay Method of measuring elasticity of demand. <br>
    Dr. Alfred  Marshall has explained the outlay method of measuring elasticity of demand.  This method is also called as total expenditure method or total revenue method.  Total expenditure means Price Quantity demanded. In this method, the elasticity  of demand is measured by comparing the change in the total expenditure on a  commodity in response to a change in the price of a commodity. This method can  be explained with the help of the following schedule:</p>

  <p>(2) <strong>Relatively  inelastic demand:</strong> When a fall in the price of a commodity also leads to a  fall in a total expenditure on a commodity and vice versa, then the demand is  said to be relatively inelastic. For example, in the above schedule, in the  case of commodity 'A', it can be seen that, as a commodity's price falls from  Rs20 to Rs210, the total expenditure on it also falls from Rs100 to Rs60.  Similarly, as a commodity's price rises from Rs10 to Rs20, the total  expenditure on it also rises from Rs60 to Rs 100. In the case of relatively  inelastic demand, the price of a commodity and the total expenditure on a  commodity are directly related to each other.<br>
    (3) <strong>Unitary  elastic demand:</strong> When a fall or a rise in the price of a commodity leads to  no change in total expenditure on a commodity, then the demand is said to be  unitary elastic. For example, in the above schedule, in the case of commodity  'B', it can be seen that, as a commodity's price falls from Rs40 to Rs30, the  total expenditure on it remains same i.e. 120. Similarly, as a commodity's  price rises from 30 to 40, the total expenditure on it remains same i.e. 120. <br>
  <strong>(4)  Relatively elastic demand:</strong> When a fall in the price of a commodity leads to  a rise in a total expenditure on a commodity and vice versa, then the demand is  said to be relatively elastic. For example, in the above schedule, in the case  of commodity 'C'. it can be seen that, as a commodity's price falls from Re60  to Rs50, the total expenditure on it rises from Rs60 to Rs100. Similarly, as a  commodity's price rises from Rs50 to Rs60, the total expenditure on it falls  from Rs100 to Rs60. In the case of relatively elastic demand, the price of a  commodity and the total expenditure on a commodity are inversely related to  each other.</p>
  <p><strong>(3)  Explain importance of elasticity of demand.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans. The  importance of elasticity of demand can be explained with the help of the  following points: </strong><br>
    <strong>(1)  Importance to producers:</strong> The concept of elasticity of demand helps the  seller in fixing the prices of his products. If the demand for a commodity sold  by the producer is inelastic, the producer can charge higher price for such a  commodity and can carn the maximum profit. On the other hand, if the demand for  a commodity sale by the producer is elastic, the producer can charge lower  price for such a commodity and can earn the profit by its maximum sale.<br>
    <strong>(2)  Importance to the Government:</strong> The concept of elasticity of demand helps the  finance minister and the government in framing the taxation policy. If the  demand for a particular commodity is inelastic, the government can collect more  revenue by imposing heavy taxes on such a commodity. Therefore, generally heavy  taxes are imposed on commodities like cigarettes, liquor, etc. On the other  hand, if the demand for a particular commodity is elastic, the government can  impose low taxes and can encourage sale of such a commodity and can collect  revenue from it.<br>
    <strong>(3)  Importance in factor pricing:</strong> The concept of elasticity of demand also  helps in the determination of wages of workers. For example, the demand for  skilled employees performing higher intellectual work is less elastic,  therefore they can demand more salary. On the other hand, the demand for  unskilled labourer performing physical work is more elastic, therefore they  have to accept comparatively low wages. <br>
    <strong>(4)  Importance in foreign trade:</strong> The concept of elasticity of demand is helpful  to the government in determining the terms and conditions for international  trade and framing the export and Import policy. If the demand for a commodity  exported is inelastic, the country can raise the price of that commodity in the  international market. On the other hand, if the demand for a commodity exported  is<br>
    L elastic,  the country can focus on its maximum export at low price in the international  market.<br>
  <strong>(5)  Public utilities:</strong> The concept of elasticity of demand is helpful to  government in taking decisions regarding manufacturing and selling various goods  and services by various sectors in a mixed economy. In order to avoid the  exploitation of the consumers and to promote the social welfare. public sector  manufactures and sells certain goods and services having less elastic demand.  For example, public utilities like railways have inelastic demand. Therefore to  avoid the exploitation of consumers, the government can either subsidise or  nationalise such public utilities. On the other hand, government allows private  sector to produce and sell those commodities having relatively elastic demand.<br>
  <strong>(6)  Proportion of expenditures:</strong> The concept of elasticity of demand is also  helpful in taking decisions regarding consumption of various goods and  services. If a proportion of expenditure on a particular product in a person's  total income is small and recurring the demand for such a product is relatively  inelastic. For example, expenditure on a newspaper. Consumer can regularly  consume such a commodity. On the other hand, if a proportion of expenditure on  a particular product in a person's total income is large and occasional, the  demand for such a product is relatively clastic. With proper economic planning,  a consumer can consumers such a commodity. For example. planned expenditure on  luxury.</p>
  <p><strong>Q. 7.  Observe the following figure and answer the questions:</strong><br>
    <strong>1)  Identify and define the degrees of elasticity of demand from the following  demand curves.</strong><br>

    <img src="12th eco ch.3b_clip_image012.jpg" alt="" width="283" height="250"></p>
  <p><strong>(2) In  the following diagram AE is the linear demand curve of a commodity. On the  basis of the given diagram state whether the following statements are true or  false. Give reasons for your answer.</strong><br>
    <img src="12th eco ch.3b_clip_image014.jpg" alt="" width="301" height="250"><br>
    <strong>(1)  Demand at point C' is relatively elastic demand.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> False <br>
    <strong>Reason:</strong> On the demand curve AE, the distance of CE is less than that of CA. Thus, point  'C' is close to X-axis. Therefore, the demand at point 'C' is not relatively  elastic, but is relatively inelastic.</p>
  <p><strong>(2)  Demand at point 'B' is unitary elastic demand.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans. </strong>False.<br>
    <strong>Reason:</strong> On the demand curve AE, the distance of BE is greater than that of BA. Thus.  point 'B' is close to Y-axis. Therefore, the demand at point 'B' is not unitary  elastic, but is relatively elastic.</p>
  <p><strong>(3)  Demand at point 'D' is perfectly inelastic demand.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> False.<br>
    <strong>Reason:</strong> On the demand curve AE, the distance of DE is equal to that of A. Thus, point  D' is equally close to (equally good away from) X-axis and Y-axis. Therefore,  the demand at point D' is not perfectly inelastic. but is unitary elastic.</p>
  <p><strong>(4)  Demand at point A' is perfectly elastic demand.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> True.<br>
    <strong>Reason:</strong> On the demand curve AE, at point A the lower segment of the demand curve is AE  and there is no upper segment of the demand curve. Thus at point A' the  numerical value of upper segment of the demand curve is zero. Thus. at point A,  the distance AE is greater than that of zero. Thus, point A' lies on the  Y-axis. Therefore, the demand at point A' is perfectly elastic.</p>
