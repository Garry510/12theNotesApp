  <p><strong>Q. 3.  Identify and explain the concepts from the given illustrations:ssssssss</strong><br>
    <strong>1) Gauri  collected the information about the income of a particular firm.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> <strong>(A)</strong> <strong>Identified concept:</strong> Study of individual economic unit. <br>
    <strong>(B)</strong> <strong>Explanation  of concept:</strong> The study of economic behaviour of a particular unit by  isolating it from the other forces of economy is known as the study of  individual economic unit. For example, microeconomics deals with the study of  individual economic units such as individual firm, individual price, etc</p>
  <p><strong>2) Ramesh  decided to take all decisions related to production, such as what and how to  produce?</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans. (A)  Identified concept:</strong> Business decision in a free market economy<br>
    <strong>(B)</strong> <strong>Explanation  of concept:</strong> In a free market economy, producer has to make some decisions  in order to achieve efficiency in production. Such decisions are called  business decisions in a free market economy. The producer has to take business  decisions regarding the price of the product. Production cost, etc. In case of  business decision in a free market economy, there is no intervention by the  government or any other agency.</p>
  <p><strong>3)  Shabana paid wages to workers in her factory and interest on her bank loan.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans. (A)</strong> <strong>Identified concept:</strong> Payment of factor price / reward.<br>
    <strong>(B)</strong> <strong>Explanation  of concept:</strong> The factors of production, viz. land. labour, capital and  entrepreneur are essential for the production of goods. These factors of  production get rewards in the form of rent, wages, interest and profit  respectively from the producer.</p>
  <p><strong>Q. 4.  Answer the following: </strong><br>
    <strong>1)  Explain the features of Micro economics</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> <strong>Features  of Micro Economics: </strong><br>
    <strong>1) Study  of Individual Units:</strong> Micro economics is the study of the behavior of small  individual economic units, like individual firm, individual price, individual  household etc. <br>
    <strong>2) Price  Theory:</strong> Micro economics deals with determination of the prices of goods and  services as well as factors of production. Hence, it is known as price theory.<br>
    <strong>3)  Partial Equilibrium:</strong> Equilibrium is the balance between two factors. Micro  economic analysis deals with partial equilibrium which analyses equilibrium  position of an individual economic unit i.e. individual consumer, individual  firm, individual industry etc. It isolates an individual unit from other forces  and studies its equilibrium independently.<br>
    <strong>4) Based  on Certain Assumptions:</strong> Micro economics begins with the fundamental  assumption, &quot;Other things remaining constant&quot; (Ceteris Paribus) such  as perfect competition, laissez-faire policy, pure capitalism, full employment  etc. These assumptions make the analysis simple,<br>
    <strong>5)</strong> <strong>Slicing  Method:</strong> Micro economics use slicing method. It splits or divides the whole economy  into small individual units and then studies each unit separately in detail.  For example, study of individual income out of national income, study of  individual demand out of aggregate demand etc.<br>
    <strong>6) Use of  Marginalism Principle:</strong> The concept of Marginalism is the key tool of micro  economic analysis. The term 'marginal' means change brought in total by an  additional unit. Marginal analysis helps to study a variable through the  changes. Producers and consumers take economic decisions using this principle.<br>
    <strong>7)</strong> <strong>Analysis  of Market Structure: </strong>Micro economics analyses different market structures  such as Perfect Competition, Monopoly, Monopolistic Competition, Oligopoly etc.<br>
    <strong>8)</strong> <strong>Limited  Scope:</strong> The scope of micro economics is limited to only individual units. It  doesn't deal with the nationwide economic problems such as inflation,  deflation, balance of payments, poverty, unemployment, population, economic  growth etc.</p>
  <p><strong>2)  Explain the importance of Macro economics.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.  Importance of Macroeconomics:</strong><br>
    <strong>1)  Functioning of an Economy:</strong> Macro economic analysis gives us an idea of the  functioning of an economic system. It helps us to understand the behaviour  pattern of aggregate variables in a large and complex economic system.<br>
    <strong>2)  Economic Fluctuations:</strong> Macro economics helps to analyse the causes of  fluctuations in income, output and employment and makes an attempt to control  them or reduce their severity.<br>
    <strong>3)  National Income:</strong> Study of macro economics has brought forward the immense  importance of the study of national income and social accounts. Without a study  of national income, it is not possible to formulate correct economic policies.<br>
    <strong>4)  Economic Development: </strong>Advanced studies in macro economics help to  understand the problems of developing countries such as poverty, inequalities  of income and wealth, differences in the standards of living of the people etc.  It suggests important steps to achieve economic development.<br>
    <strong>5)  Performance of an Economy: </strong>Macro economics helps us to analyse the 307 lpM  performance of an economy. National Income (NI) estimates are used to measure  the performance of an economy over time by comparing the production of goods  and services in one period with that of the other period.<strong></strong><br>
    <strong>6) Study  of Macro economic Variables: </strong>To understand the working of the economy,  study of macro economic variables are important. Main economic problems are  related to the economic variables such as behaviour of total income, output,  employment and general price level in the economy.<br>
    <strong>7) Level  of Employment: </strong>Macro economics helps to analyse the general level of  employment and output in an economy.</p>
  <p><strong>3)  Explain the scope of Macro economics.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> The  scope of microeconomics is mainly confined to price theory and resource  allocation. Microeconomics seeks to obtain solutions to the basic economic  questions such as what goods are to be produced, how many goods are to be  produced, who should produce goods, how the goods are to be produced, how the  produced goods are to be distributed, how the resources are to be efficiently  allocated to production and consumption, etc. Thus, the scope of microeconomics  can be explained as follows:<br>
    <strong>(A) Price  Theory:</strong> The scope of microeconomics is confined to price theory. It  includes following price theories:</p>
  <p><strong>Q.5 State  with reasons whether you agree or disagree with the following sentences:</strong><br>
    <strong>(1) The  scope of microeconomics is unlimited</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans. No,  I disagree with this statement.</strong><br>
    <strong>Reasons: </strong>(1)  The term 'microeconomics' is derived from the Greek word 'mikros' which means a  small or millionth part. Thus, microeconomics studies particular unit of an  economy.<br>
    (2)  Microeconomics studies the economic individual demand, individual supply,  individual income, price of a particular product, etc.<br>
    (3)  Microeconomics studies how a particular consumer tries to attain maximum  satisfaction and How a particular producer tries to attain maximum profit.  Microeconomics does not include the study of the large aggregates. Thus,  microeconomics is not aggregative but is individualistic in nature. Therefore,  the scope of microeconomics is not unlimited but it is limited.</p>
  <p><strong>(2)  Macroeconomics deals with the study of individual behaviour.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans. No,  I disagree with this statement.</strong><br>
    <strong>Reasons: </strong>(1)  Macroeconomics does not study the individual economic unit such as particular  consumer, individual demand, particular seller, individual supply, price determination  of particular good, etc.<br>
    (2)  Microeconomics studies individual economic units and deals with how a  particular consumer attain maximum satisfaction and how a particular producer  attain maximum profit.<br>
    (3)  Macroeconomics studies the economic behaviour of aggregates, their functional  relationship. their<br>
    interdependence,  their determination and causes of fluctuations in them.  Thus, macroeconomics does not deal with the  study of individual behaviour, rather it deals with the study of behaviour of  aggregates.</p>
  <p><strong>(3)  Macroeconomics is different from microeconomics.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans. Yes,  I agree with this statement.</strong><br>
    <strong>Reasons:</strong> (1) Macroeconomics is the study of entire economy. On the other hand,  microeconomics is a study of a particular segment of an economy<br>
    (2)  Macroeconomics studies aggregate demand, aggregate supply, national income,  general price level, etc. On the other hand, microeconomics studies individual  demand, individual supply, individual income, price determination of particular  product, etc.<br>
    (3)  Macroeconomics follows general equilibrium analysis. On the other hand,  microeconomics follows partial equilibrium analysis. Macroeconomics uses  lumping method. On the other hand,<br>
    Micro economics  uses slicing method. Therefore, macroeconomics is different from micro economics.</p>
  <p><strong>(4)  Microeconomics uses slicing method.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans. Yes,  I agree with this statement.</strong><br>
    <strong>Reasons:</strong> (1) Microeconomics studies the individual economic units of an economy. For example,  study of a particular firm.<br>
    (2) For  studying individual economic units, microeconomics splits the economy into  small individual economic units.<br>
    (3) Then it  studies the economic behaviour of each individual economic unit separately in  detail. Therefore, microeconomics uses slicing method.</p>
  <p><strong>(5)  Microeconomics is known as Income Theory</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> No, I disagree with this statement. <br>
    <strong>Reasons:</strong> (1) Income Theory lies within the scope of macroeconomics. <br>
    (2)  Microeconomics explains how the prices of a variety of goods and services are  determined. Thus, theories of demand, supply, production function and cost fall  within the scope of microeconomics.<br>
    (3)  Microeconomics also explains how the prices of factors of production, viz.,  land, labour, capital and entrepreneur are determined. Thus, theories rent,  wages, interest and profit fall within the scope of microeconomics. Therefore,  microeconomics, is not known as Income Theory but is known as Price Theory.</p>
  <p><strong>Q.6  Answer in detail:</strong><br>
    <strong>(1)  Explain the importance of microeconomics</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans. The  importance of microeconomics can be explained with the help of the following  points: </strong><br>
    <strong>(1)  Helpful in explaining price determination:</strong> Microeconomics helps in  explaining the price determination of goods and services as well as factors of  production.<br>
    <strong>(2)  Helpful to understand the working of free market economy:</strong> Microeconomics  helps to understand how free market economy works and gets regulated by demand  and supply principles. Microeconomics helps producers to take business  decisions about what to produce, how to produce. how much to produce, etc. at  individual levels. There is no intervention by government or any other agency  in this decision making process. <br>
    <strong>(3)  Helpful in foreign trade: </strong>Microeconomics is useful in studying the aspects  related to foreign trade such as  effects  of tariff, determination of exchange rate, gains from international trade, etc.<br>
    <strong>(4)  Helpful in economic model building:</strong> Microeconomics helps in understanding  complex economic situations with its variety of models. Many terms, concepts,  terminologies, tools of economic analysis of microeconomics have valuably  contributed to the science of economics.<br>
    <strong>(5)  Helpful to businessmen in taking business decisions:</strong> Microeconomics help  businessmen in formulating prices of products or services, minimizing the cost  of production, analysing profitability of investment, attainment of maximum  productivity, etc. It also helps businessmen in demand forecasting<br>
    <strong>(6)  Useful to government:</strong> Microeconomics is useful to government in framing  economic policies such as tax policy, public expenditure policy, price policy,  etc. Microeconomics also guides government in attaining the goal of efficient  allocation of resources and economic welfare of society.<br>
    <strong>(7) Basis  of welfare economics:</strong> Microeconomics provides explanation for the  conditions of economic welfare. It explains how the maximum welfare of people  in society can be achieved by avoiding wastage of resources. Thus,  microeconomics has many theoretical and practical importance as well as uses.</p>
  <p><strong>(4)  Explain the concept of macroeconomics and Its features.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> The word macro is derived from the Greek word 'makros', meaning large or  aggregate (total). Macroeconomics therefore is the study of aggregates covering  the entire economy. It is also known as Theory of Income and Employment or  simply as Income Analysis. The following are the features of macroeconomics:<br>
    <strong>(1) Study  of aggregates: </strong>Macroeconomics deals with the study of a nation's economy as  a whole. It is the study of very large, economy-wide aggregates such as  national output or national income, total employment, aggregate demand.,  aggregate supply total investment, total consumption, general price level, etc.<br>
    <strong>(2)  Income theory:</strong> Macroeconomics is also known as theory of Income and  Employment or Income Analysis. Macroeconomics explains the determination of the  level of national income and employment and what causes fluctuations in them.  Further It explains the growth of national income over a long period of time  and social accounting.<br>
    <strong>(3)  General equilibrium analysis:</strong> Macro economic analysis is based on general  equilibrium analysis. This analysis deals with entire economy in the context of  equilibrium. It studies the behaviour of number of economic variables at a time  and takes into consideration their functional relationship and interdependence.  It explains how aggregate supply and aggregate demand are brought into equality  and how equilibrium between these forces determine price level as well as level  of income and employment. This whole analysis involves the study of number of  variables and their interaction.<br>
    <strong>(4) Based  on interdependence:</strong> Macroeconomics takes accounts of interdependence  between aggregate economic variables such as national income. total output,  employment level, total investment and price level, etc. For example, it  explains how change in the level of total investment will finally change the  level of national income, total output, employment level and eventually level  of economic growth.<br>
    <strong>(5) Use  of lumping method: </strong>Macroeconomics deals with the behaviour of aggregates,  i.e. total values of economic variables related to whole economy. It uses  method of lumping to deal with macro variables such as aggregate demand,  aggregate supply, national output, etc.<br>
    <strong>(6) Study  of growth models:</strong> Macroeconomics studies in detail various factors that  contribute to economic growth and development, Macroeconomics is useful in  developing economic growth models. These economic growth models are used for  studying economic development. For example. Mahalanobis growth model emphasized  on basie heavy industries.<br>
    <strong>(7) Study  of general price level: </strong>Macroeconomics studies the determination of general  price level. General price level is the average of all prices of goods and  services currently being produced in the economy. Macroeconomics also studies  the changes in the general price level. i.e. trade cycles.<br>
    <strong>(8)  Policy oriented:</strong> Macroeconomics, according to Keynes, is a policy oriented  science. Macroeconomic analysis helps in formulating suitable economic policies  to promote economic growth. to generate employment to control inflation, to  pull the economy out of depression, etc.</p>
