  <p><strong>Explanation  of diagram: </strong>In the above diagram Y-axis represents the price of the  chocolates and X-axis represents supply of chocolates. From the above diagram  it can be seen that, as price of chocolates rises from Rs10 to Rs40, the supply  of chocolates rises from 200 units to 500 units. Similarly, as price of  chocolates falls from Rs 40 to Rs 10, the supply of chocolates falls from 500  units to 200 units. Therefore, supply curve of chocolates slopes upwards from  the left to the right.<br>
    <strong>(3)  Relationship between price and quantity supplied:</strong> From the above supply  schedule and supply curve of chocolates, it can be seen that, At low price of  chocolates ie. at Rs 10, the supply of chocolates is also less i.e. 200 units.  Similarly at high price of chocolates i.e, at Rs 40, the supply of chocolates  is also high i.e. 500 units. Thus, it can be seen that the price of chocolates  and quantity supplied of chocolates have direct relation between them.</p>

  <p><strong>Explanation  of diagram:</strong> In the diagram, Y-axis represents the price of the potatoes and  X-axis represents market supply of potatoes. From the above diagram it can be  seen that, as price of potatoes rises from Rs 1 to Rs 4, the supply of  chocolates rises from 100 Kg to 154 Kg. Similarly, as price of potatoes falls  from Rs 4 to Rs 1, the market supply of potatoes falls from 154 Kg to 100 Kg.  Therefore, market supply curve of potatoes slopes upwards from the left to the  right.</p>
  <p><strong>Q.6  Answer the following:</strong><br>
    <strong>(1)  Explain the concept of total cost and total revenue.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> [A] <strong>Total Cost: (1) Meaning:</strong> Total cost is the total expenditure  incurred by a firm on the factors of production required for the production of  goods and services. Total cost is the sum of total fixed cost and total variable  cost at various levels of output. <br>
    <strong>(2)  Formula:</strong> Total cost is calculated as follows:<br>
    TC=TFC + TVC  Where, TC = Total Cost, TFC = Total Fixed Cost and TVC = Total Variable Cost.<br>
    (<strong>a) Total  Fixed Cost (TFC):</strong> Total fixed costs are those expenses of production which  are incurred on fixed factors such as land, machinery, etc.<br>
  <strong>(b) Total  Variable Cost (TVC):</strong> Total variable costs are those expenses of production  which are incurred on variable factors such as labour, raw material, power,  fuel, etc.<br>
  <strong>(3)  Example:</strong> If a particular manufacturer has incurred a total fixed cost of  50,000 and a total variable cost of 40,000 for manufacturing 20 fans, the total  cost can be calculated as follows: TC = TFC TVC <br>
    ∴TC=50,000+40,000 <br>
    ∴TC  =90,000<br>
    ∴Total  Cost= 90,000. (1) </p>
  <p><strong>[B] Total  Revenue: </strong>Meaning: Total revenue is the total sales proceeds of a firm by  selling a commodity at a given price. It is the total income of a firm.<strong></strong><br>
    <strong>(2)  Formula:</strong> Total revenue is calculated as follows: Total Revenue Price x  Quantity<br>
    <strong>(3)  Example:</strong> If a particular manufacturer sells fans by charging 6000 per unit,  the total revenue can be  calculated as  follows:<br>
    TR= PxQ<br>
    ∴TR=6,000  x 20<br>
    ∴TR =  1,20,000<br>
    ∴Total  Revenue = 1,20,000.</p>
  <p><strong>2)  Explain the determinant of supply.</strong><br>
    Ans. Explain  the determinants of supply. <strong>The determinants of supply are as follows:</strong>   <strong>(1)  Price:</strong> Price Is the most important factor influencing the supply of a  commodity. Price and supply are directly related to each other, i.e. more Is  supplied at a higher price and less is supplied at a lower price. <br>
  <strong>(2) State  of technology:</strong> Technological improvements reduce the cost of production,  which lead to an increase in production and supply. On the other hand,  traditional and outdated technology reduced the supply.<br>
  <strong>(3) Cost  of Production:</strong> Cost of production and supply have inverse relation. For  example, if the price of factors of production increases, the cost of  production also increases. This in turn decreases the profit margin of supplier  and this in turn decreases the supply. On the other hand, fall in the cost of  production increases the supply.<br>
  <strong>(4)  Infrastructural facilities: </strong>Infrastructure in the form of transport,  communication, power, etc. influences the production process as well as supply.  Inadequate infrastructural facilities decrease the supply and vice versa.<br>
  <strong>(5)  Government policy:</strong> Government policies on taxation, subsidies, industrial  policies, etc. may encourage or discourage production and supply depending upon  government policy measures. For example, government subsidies tend to increase  the supply.<br>
  <strong>(6)  Natural conditions:</strong> The supply of agricultural products depends on the  natural conditions. For example, a good monsoon and favourable climatic  condition will produce a good harvest, so the supply of agricultural products  will increase. On the other hand, unfavourable climatic conditions will lead to  poor harvest and thus to a decrease in supply of agricultural goods.<br>
  <strong>(7)  Future expectations about price:</strong> If the prices are expected to rise in the  near future, the producer may withhold the stock. This will reduce the supply  though the current prices are high. On the other hand, if the prices are  expected to fall in the near future, the producer sells more though current  prices are low.<br>
  <strong>(8) Other  factors:</strong> Other factors like nature of the market, relative prices of other  goods, export and imports, industrial relations, availability of factors of  production, etc. determine the supply of various goods. For example,  availability of factors of production increases the supply. On the other hand,  shortage of factors of production decreases the supply.</p>
  <p><strong>Q.7  Answer in detail:</strong><br>
    <strong>(1) State  and explain the Law of Supply.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans. The  Law of Supply can be stated and explained with the help of the following  points: </strong><br>
    <strong>(1) Law  of Supply:</strong> The Law of Supply was propounded by Dr. Alfred Marshall in his  famous book, 'Principles of Economics'. The Law of Supply explains the direct  relationship between the price and the supply.<br>
    <strong>(2)  Statement of Law:</strong> &quot;Other things being constant, the higher the price  of a commodity, greater is the quantity supplied and lower the price of a  commodity, smaller is the quantity supplied.&quot; <br>
    <strong>(3)  Symbolic Representation:</strong> The Law of Supply can be expressed symbolically as  follows: a Sx = f (Px)<br>
    Where. S  stands for supply of a commodity x,f stands for function of and Px stands for  the price of a commodity x.<br>
  <strong>(4)  Individual Supply Schedule:</strong> The Law of Supply can be explained with the  help of the following individual supply schedule:</p>
  <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td width="312" valign="top"><br>
        <strong>Price (Rs)</strong></td>
      <td width="312" valign="top"><p><strong>Quantity Supplied (in units)</strong></p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="312" valign="top"><p>10</p></td>
      <td width="312" valign="top"><p>100</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="312" valign="top"><p>20</p></td>
      <td width="312" valign="top"><p>200</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="312" valign="top"><p>30</p></td>
      <td width="312" valign="top"><p>300</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="312" valign="top"><p>40</p></td>
      <td width="312" valign="top"><p>400</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="312" valign="top"><p>50</p></td>
      <td width="312" valign="top"><p>500</p></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p><strong>(5)  Explanation of Individual Supply Schedule: </strong>From the above individual supply  schedule it can be observed that at a lesser price (Rs10) less units of  commodity x are supplied (100 units). Similarly, at a higher price (Rs50) more  units of commodity x are supplied (500 units). Thus, there exists a direct  relationship between the price and the quantity supplied<br>
    <strong>(6)  Individual Supply Curve:</strong> The law of Supply can be explained with the help  of the following diagram of the individual supply curve:<br>
    <img src="12th eco ch.4_clip_image010.jpg" alt="" width="292" height="248"><br>
    <strong>(7)  Explanation of Individual Supply Curve:</strong> In the above diagram, Y-axis  represents price of a commodity x and X-axis represents supply of a commodity  x. From the above diagram it can be seen that the supply curve, i.s. S slopes  upwards from the left to the right. The supply curve has positive slope as  there is direct relationship between the price and the supply.<br>
    <strong>[B]  Exceptions to Law of Supply: </strong><br>
    <strong>The  exceptions to the Law of Supply are as follows:</strong><br>
    <strong>(1)  Labour supply :</strong> In the initial stages, labour supply increases as wage rate  increases. However, at a later stage, workers would prefer leisure to work.  They prefer to earn same amount of income by working for less hours.<br>
    Therefore,  in the initial stage, the labour supply curve slopes upward from the left to  the right. However, in the later stage, the labour supply curve bends backward.  This is explained in the following schedule and diagram :</p>
  <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td width="312" valign="top"><br>
        <strong>Wage Rate (₹)</strong><br>
        <strong>(Per Hour)</strong></td>
      <td width="312" valign="top"><p align="center"><strong>Hours of Work</strong><br>
        <strong>(Per Day)</strong></p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="312" valign="top"><p align="center">100</p></td>
      <td width="312" valign="top"><p align="center">5</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="312" valign="top"><p align="center">200</p></td>
      <td width="312" valign="top"><p align="center">7</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="312" valign="top"><p align="center">300</p></td>
      <td width="312" valign="top"><p align="center">6</p></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p><img src="12th eco ch.4_clip_image012.jpg" alt="" width="165" height="159"><br>
    From the  schedule and diagram it can be seen that in the initial stages as wage rate  rises from * 100 to 200, the supply of labour also rises from 5 hours to 7  hours. However, when the wage rate rises from 200 to 300, the supply of labours  do not rise further; rather it is reduced from 7 hours to 6 hours. Thus, after  the wage level 200, the supply curve slopes backwards from the point A towards  Y-axis indicating that at higher prices fewer labour hours are supplied.<br>
  <strong>(2)  Agricultural goods :</strong> Agricultural goods<br>
    require  suitable climatic conditions and sufficient period of growth. Therefore, the  supply of agricultural goods cannot be increased overnight though their prices  rise. Similarly, due to favourable conditions, the supply of agricultural goods  may rise even at their constant prices. Therefore, in case of agricultural  goods the law is inapplicable. Therefore agricultural goods are exception to  the Law of Supply<br>
  <strong>(3)  Urgent need for cash :</strong> If a seller needs cash urgently he is forced to sell  more even at less prices/below market prices. Therefore, the sale of goods  influenced by the need for cash is considered as an exception to the Law of  Supply.<br>
  <strong>(4)  Perishable goods :</strong> Perishable goods like vegetables, flowers, eggs, etc.  cannot be stored for a long period of time. Seller has to bear a huge loss, if  perishable goods do not get sold. Therefore, in case of perishable goods, the  supplier would offer to sell more quantities at lower prices to avoid losses.  Therefore, the sale of perishable goods at low price is considered as an  exception to the Law of Supply. supply curve slopes backwards from the point A  towards Y-axis indicating that at higher prices fewer labour hours are  supplied.<br>
  <strong>(2)  Agricultural goods :</strong> Agricultural goods require suitable climatic  conditions and sufficient period of growth. Therefore, the supply of  agricultural goods cannot be increased overnight though their prices rise.  Similarly, due to favourable conditions, the supply of agricultural goods may  rise even at their constant prices. Therefore, in case of agricultural goods  the law is inapplicable. Therefore agricultural goods are exception to the Law  of Supply<br>
  <strong>(3)  Urgent need for cash :</strong> If a seller needs cash urgently he is forced to sell  more even at less prices/below market prices. Therefore, the sale of goods influenced  by the need for cash is considered as an exception to the Law of Supply.<br>
  <strong>(4)  Perishable goods :</strong> Perishable goods like vegetables, flowers, eggs, etc.  cannot be stored for a long period of time. Seller has to bear a huge loss, if  perishable goods do not get sold. Therefore, in case of perishable goods, the  supplier would offer to sell more quantities at lower prices to avoid losses.  Therefore, the sale of perishable goods at low price is considered as an  exception to the Law of Supply.</p>
