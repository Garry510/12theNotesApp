  <p><strong>Q. 3.  State with reasons whether you agree or disagree with the following statement</strong><br>
    <strong>1)  Obligatory function is the only function of the Government.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans:</strong> No, I disagree with this statement.<br>
    <strong>Reasons : </strong><br>
    (1) In  modern times, modern government performs many other modern optional functions  in addition to the traditional obligatory functions of defence and civic  administration.<br>
    (2) The  government performs optional functions for the purpose of boosting economic and  social development in the country. The optional functions of the government are  constantly increasing.<br>
    (3)  Provision of education and health services, implementation of social security  schemes, promotion of industrial development, employment generation, etc.  optional functions are carried out by the government.<br>
    Thus,  obligatory function is not the only function of government: it is one of many  functions.</p>
  <p><strong>(2) Fines  and penalties are a major source of revenue for the government.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> No, I disagree with this statement. <br>
    <strong>Reasons:</strong> (1) Revenue from fees and penalties is non-tax revenue. The government receives  less revenue from non-tax sources than it does from tax sources<br>
    (2) The  Government receives revenue in the form of fines and penalties only if a person  violates the law.<br>
    (3) However,  it cannot be said that many individuals will consistently violate the laws of  the country.<br>
    Therefore,  fines and penalties are not a major source of revenue for the government.</p>
  <p><strong>(3) The  Goods and Services Tax (GST) has replaced almost all indirect taxes in India.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> Yes, I agree with this statement.<br>
    <strong>Reasons:</strong> (1) Goods and Services Tax IGST has been implemented in India from 1st July  2017. Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a broad indirect tax levied on goods and  services across the country</p>
  <p>(2) Goods  and Services Tax has been imposed in place of Central Excise Duty Service Tax,  Additional Customs Duty, Value Added Tax of States, Entrance Tax, Entertainment  Tax, etc.<br>
    (3) The  price of goods and services sold to the customer is no longer subject to  various indirect taxes, but includes goods and services tax (GST). The consumer  pays Goods and Services Tax (GST) which is included in the price of goods and  services when purchasing various goods.<br>
    Thus. Goods  and Services Tax (GST) has replaced almost all indirect taxes in India,</p>
  <p> <strong>(4) Democratic governments do not lead to  increase in public expenditure.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> No, I disagree with this statement. <br>
    <strong>Reasons:</strong> (1) In many countries of the world, the modern government has adopted a policy  of intervention for the economic and social development of the country instead  of adopting a policy of non-intervention (laissez fare). <br>
    (2) For the  economic and social development of the country, the modern government is  spending heavily on optional functions such as dissemination of education,  provision of public health facilities, provision of recreational facilities,  implementation of social welfare schemes, etc.<br>
    (3) The  modern government is constantly adopting new optional (voluntary) functions on  a large scale and carrying out traditional functions more efficiently. For  this, the modern government is constantly spending more and more amount of  money.<br>
    Thus,  democratic governments lead to increase in public expenditure.</p>
  <p><strong>(5)  Public finance is more elastic than private finance.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> Yes, I agree with this statement. <br>
    <strong>Reasons:</strong> (1) Private financial transactions (finance) are carried out by individuals or  private entities for fulfilling private interests. In contrast, public finance  transactions (finance) are carried out by the government for the purpose of  maximizing the benefits to the society. <br>
    (2) The  economic and social needs of an individual do not change constantly, the needs  of an individual are relatively constant. On the contrary, the economic and  social needs of the society are constantly changing. As a result, a person's  private finance remains relatively stable. In contrast, the government's public  finance is constantly changing.<br>
    (3) For  example, in the event of a major outbreak of an infectious disease in a  country, there will not be a significant change in a person's personal  expenditure and income. But in this situation, the government has to increase  the expenditure on health facilities and for this the government can get  financial funds in various ways. Thus, public finance is more elastic than  private finance.</p>
  <p><strong>Q. 4.  Read the given passage and answer the questions:</strong><br>
  &quot;The  conventional notion of social security is that the government would make  periodic payments to look after people in their old age, ill-health, disability  and poverty. This idea should itself change from writing a cheque for the  beneficiary to institutional arrangements to care for beneficiaries, including  by enabling them to look after themselves, to a large extent.<br>
    The write-a-cheque model of social security is a legacy from the rich  world at the optimal phase of its demographic transition, when the working  population was numerals enough and earning enough to generate the taxes to pay  for the care of those not working. This model is ill-suited for less, well off  India with growing life expectancy, increasing urbanization and resultant  migration. Social security under urbanization will be different from social  security in a static society.<br>
  <strong>1) State  the conventional notion of social security.</strong><br>
  <strong>Ans:</strong> The conventional notion of social security is that the government should  provide periodic payments to concerned people to look after their old age,  ill-health, disability and poverty.</p>
  <p><strong>2) What  kind of conceptual change is suggested in the given paragraph.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans:</strong> Conceptual change in social security in the form of making institutional  arrangements to take care of the beneficiaries and making them self-reliant  instead of paying them in the form of cheques is suggested in the given  paragraph.</p>
  <p><strong>3) What  is a legacy of social security from the rich world?</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans:</strong> Optimal phase of demographic transition is a legacy of social security in a  rich world.</p>
  <p><strong>4) Which  features of India make the traditional model of social security ill-suited for  the economy?</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans:</strong> The features of India like low economic resources, increasing life expectancy,  increasing urbanization and resultant migration make the traditional model of  social security ill-suited for the economy.</p>
  <p><strong>Q. 5.  Answer the following:</strong><br>
    <strong>1) State  the types and importance of Government budget.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> The types and importance of government budget is as followings :<br>
    <strong><u>(A)  Balanced budget :</u></strong><br>
    <strong>(1)  Meaning :</strong> A budget in which government estimated revenue and its  anticipated expenditure is equal to each other is called balanced budget.<br>
    <strong>(2) Importance  :</strong> Classical economists considered a balanced budget as the best budget.  However, according to modern economists it may not be always suitable for the  modern economy.<br>
    <strong><u>(B)  Surplus budget:</u></strong><br>
    <strong>(1)  Meaning:</strong> A budget in which government estimated revenue exceeds its  anticipated expenditure is called surplus budget. <br>
    <strong>(2)  Importance :</strong> Surplus budget is used during inflation to pull down the  effective demand. </p>
  <p><strong><u>(C)  Deficit budget :</u></strong><br>
    <strong>(1)  Meaning :</strong> A budget in which government anticipated expenditure exceeds its  estimated revenue is called deficit budget. <br>
    <strong>(2)  Importance :</strong> Deficit budget is used during depression to push up the  effective demand.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>2)  Explain the principles of taxation.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> The principles (canons) of taxation propounded by Adam Smith are as follows: <br>
    <strong>(1) Canon  of equity or equality :</strong> Adam Smith suggested that every person will pay the  taxes to the government in proportion to his/her 'ability to pay. It means rich  people should pay more tax compared to the poor.<br>
    <strong>(2) Canon  of certainty :</strong> According to Adam Smith, the taxpayer should know in advance  how much tax he/she has to pay, at what time he/she has to pay the tax and in  what form the tax is to be paid to the government.</p>
  <p><strong>(3) Canon  of convenience :</strong> According to this canon, every tax should be levied in  such a manner and at such a time that its payment becomes convenient to the tax  payer.<br>
    <strong>(4) Canon  of economy :</strong> According to this canon, the cost of tax collection should be  the minimum. If a major portion of the tax proceeds is spent on the tax  collection itself, then such a tax cannot be considered as a good tax.</p>
  <p><strong>3)  Explain non-tax sources of revenue of the government.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans.</strong> Non-tax sources of revenue of the government are as follows: <br>
    <strong>(1) Fees  :</strong> Fee is paid by citizens in return for certain specific services rendered  by the government.<br>
    For example,  education fee, registration fee, etc.<br>
  <strong>(2)  Prices of public goods and services: </strong>Modern governments sell various types  of commodities and services to the citizens. A price is a payment made by the  citizens to the government for the goods and services sold to them. For  example, railway fares, postal charges, etc.<br>
  <strong>(3)  Special assessment:</strong> The payment made by the citizens of a particular locality  in exchange for certain special facilities given to them by the authorities is  known as special assessment.' For example, local bodies can levy a special tax  on the residents of a particular area where extra/special facilities of roads,  energy, water supply etc. are provided<br>
  <strong>(4) Fines  and penalties :</strong> The government imposes fines and penalties on those who  violate the laws of the country. The objective of the imposition of fines and  penalties is not to earn income, but to discourage the citizens from violating  the laws framed by the government. For example, fines for violating traffic  rules. However, the revenue from this source is comparatively limited<br>
  <strong>(5)  Gifts, grants and donations :</strong> The government may also earn some income in  the form of gifts by the citizens and others. The government may also receive  grants from the foreign governments and institutions for general and specific  purposes. Foreign aid has become an important source of development finance for  a developing country like India. However, this source of revenue is uncertain  in nature.<br>
  <strong>(6)  Special levies :</strong> The government levies duties on those commodities, the  consumption of which is harmful to the health and well-being of the citizens.  Like fines and penalties, the objective of special levies is not to earn  income, but to discourage citizens from the consumption of harmful commodities.  For example, duties levied on wine, opium and other intoxicants.<br>
  <strong>(7)  Borrowings :</strong> The government borrows from the citizens in the form of  deposits, bonds, etc. Government also get loans from foreign governments and  international organizations such as IMF, World Bank, etc. In modern times,  loans are becoming more and more popular source of revenue for the governments.</p>
  <p><strong>Q. 6.  Answer in detail:</strong><br>
    <strong>1)  Explain various reasons for the growth of public expenditure.</strong><br>
    <strong>Ans:</strong> The reasons for the growth of public expenditure are as follows:<br>
    <strong>(1)  Increase in the activities of the Government:</strong> For the economic and  social  development of the country, the  modern government is continuously sending large amount on activities like  dissemination of education, provision of health facilities, provision of  recreational services. implementation of social welfare schemes. The government  is adopting new optional functions and performing traditional obligatory  functions more efficiently. The government has to spend a lot to carry out all  these functions. As a result, public expenditure is rising.<br>
    <strong>(2) Rapid  increase in population :</strong> As India is a developing country, population  growth in India is accelerating. According to the 2011 census, India's  population was 121.02 crore. Public expenditure is increasing as the government  has to spend heavily to meet the various needs of the growing population.<br>
    <strong>(3)  Growing urbanization:</strong> In modern times, the pace of urbanization is  increasing in many countries of the world. In newly emerging and developed  urban areas, the government has to provide water supply, electricity supply,  transportation facilities, sanitation facilities, recreational facilities. For  providing these various facilities, the government has to incur continuous  expenditure and as a result public expenditure is increasing<br>
    <strong>(4)  Increasing defence expenditure :</strong> In modern times, unstable and hostile  international relations have increased. Many countries around the world are  increasing defence spending to cope with potential foreign aggression and war.  As a result, public expenditure is rising.<br>
    <strong>(5)  Spread of democracy :</strong> Most of the countries of the world have adopted the  system of democracy. In a democratic system, the process of forming a  government is carried out by holding general elections after a certain period  of time. In a country like India, which is large in size and population, huge  expenses have to be incurred for elections. As a result, public expenditure is  rising. <br>
    <strong>(6)  Inflation :</strong> Just as a person spends money on purchasing various goods and  services to meet his personal needs, so the government spends money on  purchasing various goods and services to meet the needs of the society. Prices of  most goods and services continue to rise. As a result, public expenditure is  rising.<br>
    <strong>(7)  Industrial Development :</strong> In order to achieve the objectives of increase in  production, increase in employment and overall growth in the economy. large  scale industrial development is required in the country. As a result, in  developing countries like India, a large amount of money is being spent on  industrial development schemes to boost industrial development. As a result,  public expenditure is rising.<br>
    <strong>(8)  Disaster Management:</strong> The modern government is spending heavily on managing  natural disasters like floods, earthquakes, hurricanes and man-made disasters  like social unrest, riots, wars, etc. As a result, public expenditure is  rising. </p>
